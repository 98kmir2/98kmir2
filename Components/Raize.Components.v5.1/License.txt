The entire and exclusive liability and remedy for breach of this limited warranty shall be limited to replacement of defective media or documentation and shall not include or extend to any claim for or right to recover any other damages, including but not limited to, loss of profit, data, or use of the software or special, incidental or consequential damages, or other similar claims, even if Raize Software has been specifically advised of the possibility of such damages.  In no event will Raize Software's liability for any damages to you or any other person ever exceed the lower of the list price or the actual price paid for the package or the license to use the software, regardless of the form of the claim.
