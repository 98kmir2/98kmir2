COMPLETING THE RAIZE COMPONENTS 5 INSTALLATION
==============================================
  Once the installation program is complete you may begin using the
  Raize Components in Delphi and C++Builder versions 7 and higher.  
  Restart Delphi or C++Builder and you will see the following pages 
  on the component palette:

    Raize Panels
    Raize Edits
    Raize Lists
    Raize Buttons
    Raize Display
    Raize Shell
    Raize Widgets

    
MOVING RAIZE COMPONENTS 5 PALETTE PAGES TO FRONT
================================================
  During the installation, the appropriate Raize Components design
  packages are loaded into the selected Delphi, Borland Developer
  Studio, and CodeGear RAD Studio IDEs.  Unfortunately, when you
  restart the IDE, the component palette pages for Raize Components 
  will appear at the end of the component palette.

  If you would like to move the Raize pages to the front of the
  palette, there is an a easier way to do this than by manually
  dragging them.  Located in the Bin directory is a program called
  MoveRCPagesToFront.exe, which will move all of the RC pages
  for you automatically to the front of the palette.

  Simply run the MoveRCPageToFront.exe program and follow the 
  instructions.
  

UNINSTALLING RAIZE COMPONENTS 5
===============================

  To remove Raize Components from your computer, follow the directions below.

  Removing the components from the component palette
  ==================================================

  display the Packages page in the Project Options dialog.

  Select the "Raize Components 5.x" package from the Design Packages list 
  and click the Remove button. A message box will be displayed to confirm your 
  request--press OK.  Next, depending on the IDE, you may be asked if a runtime 
  package should be from the Runtime Packages list.  If so, click OK to remove 
  the runtime package.  

  Next, select the "Raize Components 5.x (Data-Aware)" package from the 
  Design Packages list and click the Remove button. Again, a message box will 
  be displayed to confirm your request--press OK.  Next, depending on the IDE,
  you may be asked if a runtime package should be removed from the Runtime 
  Packages list.  If so, click OK to remove the runtime package.

  Close the Project Options dialog box by clicking the OK button.
                 
  Repeat the above steps for each IDE that is using Raize Components.
